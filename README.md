## Hi there 👋 I'm Prosper
Welcome to my little corner of the coding world! My pronouns are She/Her.
I'm a **Junior Front-End Web Developer** just stepping into the vast (and sometimes overwhelming) universe of web development hehe 😅.
Armed with HTML, CSS and a bucketload of enthusiasm, I'm on a mission to create beautiful, responsive, and functional websites- one line of code at a time

##⭐A Little About Me
- **Why I code:** For me, coding feels like solving a giant, ever-changing puzzle. Each line of code is a step closer to cracking the solution.
- **Puzzle Master:** From logic puzzles to crosswords, and even escape rooms, if it challenges my brain, I'm hooked. Oh, and I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 2 minutes- no big deal.
- **My Secret Power:** Turning complex ideas into clean, functional code( while enjoying the occassional "Eureka!" moment).
- **Biggest Challenge:** Balancing simplicity with creativity- because sometimes less *is* more, but other times, more is *just enough*.
- **What Gets Me Excited:* Watching a design come to life on the browser, much like the moment the last piece of a puzzle clicks into place- it's pure magic.

## 🚀What I'm Working On
- **E-commerce Layouts:** Experimenting with grid-based carousels and interactive text overlays. It's all about making pages sleek and user-friendly.
- **SEO Experiments:** Learning how to make websites more discoverable with meta tags and structured data- because what's the point of a great site if no one can find it?
- **Personal Portfolio:** Building a space to showcase my progress, projects and maybe a few happy accidents along the way.

## 🤔Why Am I Here?
I'll be honest- I'm just starting out, and there's SO much to learn. If you've got advice, tips, resources, or even just encouragement to share. I'm all ears! Let's connect and grow together.

## 🛠My Skill Set (So Far)
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS
- **Tools I'm Dabbling In:** Javascript, SEO tools
- **What I'm Eyeing Next:** React.js because dynamic UIs are cool.

## 🌌Randon Things That Keep Me Going
- I believe any website can be made 10x better with great designs and clear navigation.
- I have a soft spot for grid layouts (seriously, they're oddly satisfying).
- A good anime/animated (yeah yeah I know, I see them as two different types) series can cure even the toughest coding block (*Darwin's Game*, anyone?).

## 💬Let's Chat
If you've got a project, a suggestion, or want to nerd out about HTML and CSS, drop me a message. I'd love to connect, learn and maybe even collaborate.
**Email:** creating.minerva@gmail.com

Together, we can turn "just starting out" into "making waves"! 🌊
